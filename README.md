# NumberRecognition

Aim:

Handwritten digitrecognition using MNIST dataset .

Introduction:

The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology," referring to the organization that originally collected the dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of a large number of handwritten digits, both single digits and labels, and is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models, particularly for digit recognition tasks.

With the help of this MNIST dataset We will generate a GrayScale Image and then we will predict the number
