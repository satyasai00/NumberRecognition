# NumberRecognition

Aim:

Handwritten digitrecognition using MNIST dataset is a major project made with the help of Neural Network.

Introduction:

The MNIST dataset is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It stands for "Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology," referring to the organization that originally collected the dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of a large number of handwritten digits, both single digits and labels, and is commonly used for training and testing machine learning models, particularly for digit recognition tasks.

Here are some key details about the MNIST dataset:

1.Image Size: The dataset contains grayscale images of handwritten digits, each measuring 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width. Therefore, each image is a 28x28 pixel square.

2.Digits: MNIST includes digits from 0 to 9, representing the numbers from 0 to 9.

3.Size: The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. This split is typical for training and evaluating machine learning models.

4.Labels: Each image in the dataset is associated with a corresponding label that indicates which digit (0-9) is written in the image.

5.Usage: Researchers and machine learning practitioners use the MNIST dataset for tasks like digit recognition, classification, and deep learning model development. It serves as a benchmark dataset for testing the performance of various machine learning algorithms.

The MNIST dataset has been used extensively to develop and test algorithms for image classification and deep learning, making it a fundamental resource in the field of computer vision and machine learning. However, it's worth noting that since MNIST is a relatively simple dataset, it may not fully represent the complexity of real-world image recognition tasks. Researchers often use more challenging datasets when working on advanced image recognition problems.
